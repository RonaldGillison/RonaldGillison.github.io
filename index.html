    <h2> The Story</h2>

    <ul>
      <li> Ronald Gillison was born some 31 odd years ago in a little town
         outside of Richmond,Virginia. He was somewhat of an artistic prodigy
         going on to become the biggest movie star of our time. A rebel a renegade
         he dazzled theatre audiences with his bold character choices before his 
         fame catapulted him into politics where he would eventually become President
         of the United States. Actually he just likes to listen to music, spend time
         with his 3 year old son, and is studying web development at the University of
         Richmond.
